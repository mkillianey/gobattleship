Fun with the Go programming language!
=====================================
(My first Go application.)

The battleship *command* is in cmd/battleship.  (This is the executable.)
The battleship *library* is in pkg/battleship.  (Can be used by multiple commands.)

"make command" builds the package, installs it locally, and generates an executable command:
    ./cmd/battleship/battleship

"make test" builds and runs the tests in the battleship package:
    ./pkg/battleship
 
"make bench" builds and runs the benchmarks in the battleship package:
    ./pkg/battleship
 
"make gotest" is a more verbose form of "make test"

"make format" reformats all the go files using "gofmt"
 
"make clean" removes the cruft

"make doc" launches a webserver locally on port 8000 (set in Makefile)
that serves all of the Go content, plus the documentation for the
battleship pkg 

"make" or "make all" will clean, run tests, build, and then run benchmarks
