Fun with the Go programming language!
=====================================
(My first Go application.)

The battleship *command* is in cmd/battleship.  (This is the executable.)
The battleship *library* is in pkg/battleship.  (Can be used by multiple commands.)

"make" builds the package, installs it locally, and generates an executable command:
    ./cmd/battleship/battleship

"make test" builds and runs the tests in the battleship package:
    ./pkg/battleship
 
"make clean" removes the cruft
